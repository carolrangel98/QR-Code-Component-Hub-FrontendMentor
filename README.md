## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

By submitting the solution to the Frontend Mentor website, I noticed a few differences between the sizes I worked with, making my design look slightly different. Anyways, I think it was a great way to start, since I'm just a beginner in frontend development, and still learning things about HTML and CSS. I've worked only with things I know, and I admit that I struggled a little. But it was fun and really challenging. Will be trying new styles and other approaches to this challenge.

### Continued development

Right now, I will keep tracking my advances in HTML and CSS and then will start my journey in JavaScript, TypeScript, and some backend development languages. That's because I lack more detail in CSS, specifically. It will be a long journey, but I am absolutely into it.

### Useful resources

- (https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/294465/por-que-as-font-face-n%C3%A3o-funcionam-de-um-pc-para-outro) - My '@font-face' property was not working, so I began feeling frustrated. The link is in Portuguese since it's my mother tongue.
